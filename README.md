# Bitcoin Ti
Bitcoin has been impacting Internet and Finance industry, as well as Social Value over the 9 years since its creation, but it has also been suffering from: slow confirmation, high transaction fee, limited privacy protection and difficult evolution. All these issues constrained the original vision of Bitcoin from its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. 

Bitcoin Ti team is a group of experienced developers who are willing to unleash the possibilities of Bitcoin. We decide to fork at block height 501300, which is called – Bitcoin Ti(BTI). BTI will make bitcoin much easier to use, more convenient and smarter, with the vision of making everyone Think in Bitcoin.

Total supply of Bitcoin Ti is 21 million. All addresses with balance before block height 501300 will get same amount of BTI automatically. The team will premine 0.1 million BTI, to motivate early developers and fund the early-stage operation and promotion of the project.

Features

1.   High Scalability. Scale Bitcoin using extension block to speed up confirmation and cut down fees. 
2.   Smart Contract. Support other on-chain applications besides payment. 
3.   Confidential Transaction. Enable confidential transaction using zk-SNARKS and proof machine to protect privacy.
4.   Active Development. Support other community-friendly features in the future, including but not limited to strengthen zero-confirmation security, cross-chain transaction.

Unlike other forks, BTI developers has been working on the development for quite a while. This guarantees that BTI will be born with X11 mining algorithm, replay protection and different address format from bitcoin, which will promote the network security and protect users’ asset.

BTI’s roadmap is very clear: deployment of extension block in June 2018 and smart contract in Dec 2018, continuous development of zk-SNARKS，proof machine, zero-confirmation security strengthening, cross-chain transaction and so on.
